# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge
Welcome to my 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge repository! In this challenge, I will be building 30 mini projects solely using JavaScript. Each day, I will be revising my JavaScript concepts and creating something new to showcase what I've learned.

 # About the Challenge
This challenge is a great way to refresh your JavaScript fundamentals and explore the latest techniques and trends in JavaScript development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, there's always something new to learn in JavaScript. By taking on this challenge, you will:

1.  Build 30 mini projects using JavaScript.
2. Learn new JavaScript concepts and techniques.
3.  Gain experience with JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

 # How to Use This Repository
Each project is contained in its own folder, labeled by the day number of the challenge. Within each folder, you'll find an **index.html** file and a **script.js** file. The **index.html** file contains the HTML markup for the project, and the **script.js** file contains the **JavaScript** code. Simply open the **index.html** file in your web browser to see the project in action.
